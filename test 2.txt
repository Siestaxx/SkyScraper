Description:

  Input: 
     We can see that the first line is the DIM number, which is 4, and below, it allows us to input a 4x4 matrix. And then, we see the matrix input, it is a correct 4x4 matrix that satisfy the puzzle, which means that it does not have more than one same number in the row or column.

  Output:
     In the output, we see the following 4 lines, which is the matrix that the project require us to output in the print(), the same matrix as the input.
     Then, because we input a correct matrix puzzle, it output the statement "the puzzle is valid", as the project required in the verifyPlacement().
     Lastly, it output the requirement of the printwithVisibility(), which is correct with the verify below:
        First column from upper side: we can only see 4, which print 1 at the top.
        Second column from upper side: we can see 2, 3 and 4, which print 3 at the top.
        Third column from upper side: we can see 1, 2 and 4, which print 3 at the top.
        Last column from upper side: we can see 3 and 4, which print 2 at the top.
        First column from down side: we can see 2, 3 and 4, which print 3 at the bottom.
        Second column from down side: we can see only see 4, which print 1 at the bottom.
        Third column from down side: we can see 3 and 4, which print 2 at the bottom.
        Last column from down side: we can see 1, 2 and 4, which print 3 at the bottom.
        First row from left: we can only see 4, which print 1 at the left.
        Second row from left side: we can see 1, 3 and 4, which print 3 at the left.
        Third row from left side: we can see 3 and 4, which print 2 at the left.
        Last row from left side: we can see 2 and 4, which print 2 at the left.
        First row from right side: we can see 3 and 4, which print 2 at the right.
        Second row from right side: we can only see 4, which print 1 at the right.
        Third row from right side: we can see 2 and 4, which print 2 at the right.
        Last row from right side: we can see 1, 3 and 4, which print 3 at the right.

  From the above description, it can show our program is correct under test2.
